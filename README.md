# Organic-agriculture-data-collection-and-analysis-using-IoT-and-ANN.
Description : In this project, we focused on collecting agricultural data such as soil moisture, temperature and humidity using Arduino. We then analyzed this data through ANN to achieve
practical applications such as crop yield prediction and weather forecasting.
